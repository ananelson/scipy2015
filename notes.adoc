== Hello I'm @ananelson

* http://github.com/ananelson/talks
* Reproducibility for Software Documentation and Research
* Environment - Docker http://docker.io
* Workflow - Dexy http://dexy.it
* http://twitter.com/ananelson
* Find me at #SciPy and I will help you get started (thru Fri am)!

== Why Automate?

* Make sure your docs/research are correct.
* Automation saves you time (after initial investment).
* Detect inefficiencies and annoyances in your install process and workflow.
* Avoid implicit knowledge, easier to collaborate and disseminate.

== Docker

* Use Dockerfiles for reproducibility.
* Rebuild early, rebuild often.
* My snippets repo: http://github.com/ananelson/dockerfile-common

{{ d['Dockerfile|idio|asciisyn']['from'] }}

The ubuntu image is minimal, so we have to install some basics and do some configuration that is usually taken care of for us.

Create a locale:

{{ d['Dockerfile|idio|asciisyn']['localedef'] }}

Set up defaults for unattended apt installs (so you don't have to type -y all the time):

{{ d['Dockerfile|idio|asciisyn']['apt-defaults'] }}

Install some system utilities and convenient developer tools:

{{ d['Dockerfile|idio|asciisyn']['utils'] }}

Install python and pip:

{{ d['Dockerfile|idio|asciisyn']['python'] }}

Install asciidoctor and its dependencies (including Ruby):

{{ d['Dockerfile|idio|asciisyn']['asciidoctor'] }}

Install dexy:

{{ d['Dockerfile|idio|asciisyn']['dexy'] }}

Install the software we need for our research:

{{ d['Dockerfile|idio|asciisyn']['research'] }}

Finally, create and activate a user so we can work interactively within our image:

{{ d['Dockerfile|idio|asciisyn']['create-user'] }}

{{ d['Dockerfile|idio|asciisyn']['activate-user'] }}

Here's how we use this Dockerfile to build and launch an image:

{{ d['run-docker.sh|asciisyn'] }}

== Simpy Example

{{ d['renege.py|idio|asciisyn'] }}

    {{ d['renege.py|py'] | indent }}

Change random seed in `renege.py` and rerun dexy...

== Dexified Example

We were able to run the example as-is using Dexy, but by making some changes we can make this example more flexible. A few ideas:

* Put data in separate input file.
* Save results to an output file.
* Write prose in documents, not code files.

=== Moviegoer

A moviegoer tries to by a number of tickets (*num_tickets*) for a certain *movie* in a *theater*.

If the movie becomes sold out, she leaves the theater. If she gets to the counter, she tries to buy a number of tickets. If not enough tickets are left, she argues with the teller and leaves.

If at most one ticket is left after the moviegoer bought her tickets, the *sold out* event for this movie is triggered causing all remaining moviegoers to leave.

{{ d['renege-dexy.py|idio|asciisyn']['moviegoer'] }}

=== Customer Arrivals

Create new *moviegoers* until the sim time reaches 120

{{ d['renege-dexy.py|idio|asciisyn']['customer-arrivals'] }}

=== Simulation

{{ d['renege-dexy.py|idio|asciisyn']['run'] }}

=== Results

This simulation was run with random seed {{ d['settings.yaml'].from_yaml()['random-seed'] }}.

{% for result in d['results.json'].from_json() %}
==== {{ result['name'] }}

{% if result['is-sold-out'] %}
'{{ result['name'] }}' sold out in {{ result['sold-out-in'] }} minutes, and {{ result['queue-leavers'] }} left the queue.
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

=== Why Separate Data from Code?

* decoupling == good
* dexy manages data files for you
* easier to access data from document templates
* document templates are more flexible than `print` statements
* present data in different ways and in different documents
* easier to put data through additional pipelines (even using different languages), e.g. visualization

{{ d['plot-results.py|idio|asciisyn']['load-results'] }}

    {{ d['plot-results.py|py'] | indent }}
